# Network Security Project
### Short Purpose Of The Project
Domain mapper is a structured approach to network security of the organization.
This project is aimed at taking proactive measures to enhance the organization defense
system, as well as empowering cybersecurity teams. The goal of the network security project
is to effectively map the domains active directory objects as well as existing networks.
The domain mapper emphasizes the importance of detecting vulnerabilities and possible
exploitation methods.

The project is divided into three main sections: Scanning, Enumeration, and Exploitation.
while each is critical to the comprehensive analysis of network vulnerabilities.

## Why Do We Need This Kind of Project ? 
In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving digital landscape, the importance of robust network security
cannot be overstated. Cyber threats are becoming more sophisticated, making timely
and accurate threat detection and mitigation crucial for protecting sensitive data and
maintaining business continuity. Domain mapper is designed to meet these challenges
head-on by providing an automated solution that enhances the detection and analysis of
network vulnerabilities.

This project is necessary not only for identifying potential security gaps but also for
adapting quickly to new cybersecurity challenges as attackers continually refine their
strategies and tactics.

### Project Structure:
The Domain mapper framework is meticulously designed to meet diverse network
security analysis needs. It features a modular and menu-driven architecture that
allows cybersecurity analysts to tailor their scanning, enumeration, and exploitation
activities precisely. Each component of the framework is dedicated to specific tasks,
enhancing the usability and effectiveness of the security analysis
